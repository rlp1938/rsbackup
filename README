README for rsbackup.

Uses two scripts, backup.sh for routine use, and cleanup.sh for sometime
use. The normal backup script does no deletion in the backup copy but
writes a list of what would have been deleted to $HOME/cruft. After
manual review of the content of 'cruft', the cleanup script may be run.

See INSTALL for installation.

Once installed and it is being run regularly by cron or manually you
should review $HOME/cruft and $HOME/backup.log
