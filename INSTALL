INSTALL for rsbackup

Whether you clone the repo or download the zip file, once you have
access to the files:
chmod +x backup.sh
chmod +x cleanup.sh
sudo cp backup.sh /usr/local/bin
sudo cp cleanup.sh /usr/local/bin
cp excludes $HOME

After that I suggest you make a cron job to regularly run backup.sh
